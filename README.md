# Dependency Aware Caching
This repository presents the code for the implemenetation and the reproduction of the experiments in the paper "Dependency-Aware Online Caching".

## Usage
In order to reproduce the experiments in the paper "Dependency-Aware Online Caching", you can run the codes in `comparison.ipynb`. This file includes step by step instruction on how to generate the results. The other files and directories are also as follows:
- `algorithms.py`: Includes the implementation of the algorithms in the paper
- `treespace.py`: The implementation of a tree structure and Nodes as python classes
- `utils.py`: Some helper methods used for generating the results
- `results`: All of the results and the plots in the paper are saved in this directory
- `data`: The raw generated data used for the plots in the paper.
- `examples`: Some other example usages of the code, not included in the paper
